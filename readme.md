# mock-cve-data

### Getting Started

-   `npm install` from the root of the repository will install the needed dependencies
-   In the extensions pane, search for `@recommended`, and install the recommended extensions
    -   All team code linting / formatting will happen upon saving
-   `npm run watch` will spin up the api in watch mode (code changes will refresh)

### Testing

Endpoints are tested with jest and the supertest library. An example is available
in the `app.test.ts` file.

-   `npm run test:watch` will run all `*.test.ts` files in watch mode
-   `npm run view:coverage` will startup a server to serve the coverage report
    for you to view in your browser

### Deployment

Deployment to the azure environment happens manually with the following
commands. (You'll need to be configured to have azure cluster access in advance)

-   Build a docker image: `docker build . -t smartcitiesdata/mock-cve-data:latest`
-   Push that new image to docker hub: `docker push smartcitiesdata/mock-cve-data:latest`
-   Remove existing mock-cve-data release: `helm uninstall mock-cve-data -n urban-os-demo-services`
-   Helm install a new release: `helm install mock-cve-data ./chart -n urban-os-demo-services --create-namespace`

**note:** It'd be nice if we could just upgrade the helm release, but that hasn't been
pulling a new image even though the pull policy in the chart is set to Always

-   Upgrading the api command: `helm upgrade mock-cve-data ./chart -n urban-os-demo-services`

### UI

The UI is served by the application from the root (<host>:3000/), and is accessible
once the application is running.

### API Dependencies Note

-   Anything needed by typescript to build (including `@types` packages) need to
    be included in the `dependencies`, not the `devDependencies`. This could be
    changed to be more conventional, but the dockerfile steps would also need
    to be updated. This is because at this time, the docker image performs a
    typescript build in addition to starting the app.

### Where data came from: `cve_path_json` and `scripts/clean_cve_json.ts`

Here's an outline of how mock CVE data was gathered for usage in this API.
Might be helpful if we end up needing to pull new CVE data for new paths.

-   IDs queried (sql_queries.md)
-   Messages for those IDs queried (sql_queries.md)
-   visualize the resulting messages in kepler
-   if it looks reasonable, use the rectangle select to filter a layer, export only that region
-   convert filtered csvs to .json for easier use in javascript (https://csvjson.com/)
-   those json files are to be placed in the CVE_PATH_JSON directory with the name `{path_id}.json`
-   Update the PATH_IDS variable in the configuration file to include the new additions
-   Run `npm run script:cleancve`
    -   this will iterate through all the PATH_IDS and create a `{path_id}_cleaned.json` file
    -   this file is what the Mock API loads in to serve on the /data endpoint

**Note:** Currently the "cleaned" CVE data is sorted by time. When we eventually
visualize cars traveling through this data, if we see jumps in travel, we may
need to adjust our SQL query to return data for an ID within a range of
time. This would ensure that data is more likely to have been collected within
a single trip of travel.
